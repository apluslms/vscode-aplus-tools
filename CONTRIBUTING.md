# Contributing

Before guiding you through the contribution process, we thank you for using Aplus Tools and wanting to contribute to the
growth of this project. :tada:

## How to contribute

There are two ways of contributing to our project. The first one is by creating new
[issues](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise/2.15/user/articles/creating-an-issue) and the second is by creating
[Pull requests](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request).
In both cases, you must read the following instructions to guide you through the process of contributing to the
[Aplus Tools](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/) project.

## Issues

If you have experienced problems while using the extension, or if you have found a bug or if you want to recommend a new
feature, you can create a new issue in our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/jaguarfi/vscode-aplus-tools/issues).
In order to create new issues, you  must adhere to the following guidelines.

1. First and most important, use proper language, respect others, and be polite with your comments.
2. Before adding a new issue, look at the list of issues to see if someone has already reported a similar issue. If so,
   please add your comments to the existing issue. Otherwise, read the following steps to create a new issue.
2. Add a self-explanatory title
3. Add a proper description of the problem. Images or small GIFs are more than welcome.
4. In the description, please also add a Use Case
5. If you know how to fix the issue, you can add a brief description telling how you would solve the issue. Having
   suggestions on how to solve the issue will promote discussion and will help to find the most suitable solution before
   creating a pull request.

## Pull Request

[new Pull Request](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork)
The changes will be reviewed and possibly merged into the Aplus Tools project.
